# ATCSRoboKin

Given a 4-axis robotic arm controlled by a Raspberry Pi, I implemented a simulation in Python, creating a rendering engine to visualize 3D space, utilizing affine transformations and homogeneous coordinates, with additional support for real time update engines. I also implemented an inverse kinematics algorithm to determine the joint angles required to position the end effector to a given pose. All mathematical formulations is documented in the .PDF write-up, located in the root directory.
